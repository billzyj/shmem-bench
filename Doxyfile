# Doxyfile 1.11.0

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project

# All text after a `#' in the configuration file is considered a comment and
# will be ignored

# The format is:
#   TAG = value [value, ...]

# All values after a tag are space or comma separated.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project related configuration options

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "shmem-bench"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 0.1

# The PROJECT_BRIEF tag can be used to add a one line description of the project
PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Benchmark suite for OpenSHMEM implementations."

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path
# is entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started.
# If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./docs

# The GENERATE_HTML tag can be used to disable the HTML output.
# Possible values are YES and NO.

GENERATE_HTML          = YES

# The GENERATE_LATEX tag can be used to disable the generation of the LaTeX 
# files. 
# Possible values are YES and NO.

GENERATE_LATEX         = YES

# The EXTRACT_ALL tag can be used to enable the extraction of all entities 
# from the source files (if defined).

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files.

INPUT                  = src

# The FILE_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify one or more wildcard patterns 
# (like *.cpp and *.h) to filter out the source files in the directories.
# Note that if this tag is empty or omitted all files are included.

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.cpp *.hpp

# The EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify one or more wildcard patterns 
# to exclude certain files from being processed. 
# Note that the wildcard syntax is similar to the one used in FILE_PATTERNS.
# For example if you want to exclude all test directories you could specify:
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       = */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       =

# The EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags can be used to specify whether
# the members (attributes and methods) of a class that are declared private 
# or static should be included in the documentation.
# Possible values are YES and NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = NO
EXTRACT_STATIC         = NO

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the
# graphical tree view of the documentation.
